I write this blog for accountability, but my intention is also to keep this anonymous in case someone discovers it. 

I am 26 years old and I feel like I have been stuck in a rut for a couple of years where I set goals and it seems like I am making progress but then no real progress is made. I also suffer from bouts of depression every now and then and having a journal helps in coping with the loneliness. 

I hope to write this journal for the rest of my life, because it would be beautiful. To keep track of how far I have come and how over the years, my thoughts and priorities have changed. 

May my lord grant me the strength to continue this endeavour.

Jai Shree Ram.
