If you're not happy, just leave. I've seen so many people just forget about this option. Trying to fix a broken situation is not easy, and more often than not, is not worth the effort.

Just leave.

Find something better. There's a whole world out there. You don't have to explain yourself. The very fact that you're not happy is enough. I think people really take the time we have on this earth for granted. I know I used to. 

I have seen people stick it out with unhappy marriages for decades. They say its "for the children" or some other excuse but the truth is, they're afraid. I think most people stay in a bad situation because they are afraid they won't find anything better.

I think its better to be alone than stay with someone that makes you feel alone.

I've seen people stay with bad employers for years for the same reason. They're afraid they won't find something better. They lack confidence. And confidence comes from options. And options come from putting in a shit ton of effort.

So put in the effort, work on yourself, find some options, and then leave. Or leave first, and then find something else. You'll be that much more motivated.

Don't stay engaged with a bad situation. Leave. Walk away.

Discourse is always optional.
